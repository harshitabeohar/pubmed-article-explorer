// This is a Tailwind CSS configuration file that specifies the content sources
// where Tailwind should look for class names to generate styles. It also allows
// for extending the default theme and adding plugins, though none are specified here.
// The configuration is set up to work with JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX/TSX files
// in the specified directories.
// The `content` array includes the main HTML file and all JavaScript/TypeScript files
// in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.
// The `theme` object is currently empty, meaning it uses the default Tailwind theme.
// The `plugins` array is also empty, indicating no additional plugins are being used.
